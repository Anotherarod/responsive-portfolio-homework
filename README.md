Contact.html:

For this assingment the challenge was using bootstrap tools to build a webpage utilizing rows, columns, etc.

For the contact page the navbar is the more approachable tool as things got tricky after that.

Styling the navbar and adding the links was quite challenging and I had difficulty changing the background of the links to teal or changing that specific row to white. 

After many trial and error periods I was able to make the links functional within each other by utilizing their urls and inputing them as href= and having their links coincide.

Index.html :

This part reminded me of some exercises we did in the first week so I had all the tools to with floats, among other things.

Experimenting with containers and classes and their supposed location was educational but frustrating at times as it can be easily overlooked if you aren't taking notice of tag that may or may not be closed/open

I had trouble witht this one alot. Getting the pictures sized properly and witht text proved to be impossibe, atleast for now. I couldn't figure out how to input a text bar overlap on the jpeg, so to not leave it without effort I provided what I could in an effort to give the page more substance.

 Also, like with every html I couldn't align my name perfectly centered as I'd like. Frustrating but part of the process as I have learned a ton in just one week.

 Lastly: I am not sure I did the denominations of the pixels correctly on the page so that it converts and sizes depending on screen size. This is something that I am sure I will need to work hard on to improve and be proficient in.
